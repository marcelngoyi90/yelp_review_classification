# yelp_review_classification
This project builds a sentiment classification model using Yelp restaurant reviews.   The goal is to automatically determine whether a review expresses **positive** or **negative** sentiment.   We focus specifically on **1-star** (negative) and **5-star** (positive) reviews to create a clean binary classification problem.
